# Using_Social_Theory_SIMP56
This repo contains the codes used during the second part of the course *Using Social Theory*, including A: Group work and B: Social Network Analysis Lab Assignments.

In the **Group work**, R Studio was used to collect data from Twitter(Now "X") through API. Three group members manually coded the data and carried out content analysis on *Engagement with Intolerant Content on Twitter*. Intercode Reliability was examined.  

The **Social Network Analysis Report** contains R codes which answer task questions that explore social networks, and analyse their properties and draw social network plots.
